# Email Spam Classification

**Welcome to [Naive Bayes Spam Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering)!**

Naive Bayes spam filtering utilize the [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) to identify spam emails from regular emails. This repository uses [scikit-learn library](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) to perform prediction.
